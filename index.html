        <strong>Jupiter</strong> is the largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter larger than any of the other planets in the solar system. It is made up of mostly hydrogen and helium, therefore it lacks a solid surface. Jupiter has 95 moons, which is the second most, behind Saturn.

         In Newtons thought thought experiment, he <em>imagines</em> that if a cannon ball on top of an exteremely tall moutain were fired at a high enough speed, the Earth would fall away from the cannnon ball just as fast as the ball would fall to the <u>Earth</u>, achiving orbit. The periapsis is the point in orbit in which the spacecraft is closes to the object being orbited. The Apoapsis is the point in orbit in which the spacecraft is the furtherest to the object being orbited.
